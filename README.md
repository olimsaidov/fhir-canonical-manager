## Installation

```bash
bun install @atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager
# or
npm install @atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { CanonicalManager } from '@atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager';

// Create and initialize the manager
const manager = CanonicalManager({
    packages: ["hl7.fhir.r4.core"],
    workingDir: "tmp/fhir",
    registry: "https://fs.get-ig.org/pkgs/" // optional, default registry
});

await manager.init();

// Resolve and read a resource
const resource = await manager.resolve('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient');
console.log(resource.url); // http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient
```

## Browser usage

Use the browser entry with the same factory name. Bundle it with your application; its Worker supplies its own runtime adapters, so the application does not need Node polyfills. A Content Security Policy must permit `worker-src blob:` and `connect-src` access to the registry. No `unsafe-eval` is required.

```typescript
import { createCanonicalManager } from '@atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager/browser';

const manager = createCanonicalManager({
    packages: ['hl7.fhir.r4.core@4.0.1'],
});
await manager.init();
const patient = await manager.resolve('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient');
const humanName = await manager.resolve('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/HumanName', {
    sourceContext: { id: patient.id },
});
await manager.destroy();
```

Packages are fetched directly from `https://packages.simplifier.net/`. Another `registry` must serve npm-compatible packuments with `dist.tarball` and an advertised `dist.integrity` or `dist.shasum`; its selected tarballs must have the same origin and allow browser CORS requests. `fetch` can supply a request function and receives supported headers, method, cancellation, omitted credentials and rejected redirects. There is no fallback to public npm. The browser treats packages as data and never runs lifecycle scripts.

The default cache is in memory. For persistence and offline reloads, supply IndexedDB:

```typescript
import { createCanonicalManager, createIndexedDbCache } from '@atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager/browser';

const cache = await createIndexedDbCache('my-fhir-packages');
const manager = createCanonicalManager({ packages: ['hl7.fhir.r4.core@4.0.1'], cache });
await manager.init();
// Later, release this manager and the cache connection that your application owns:
await manager.destroy();
cache.close();
```

Pinned `@npmcli/arborist@10.0.3` and pacote own version selection, placement, conflicts and cycles. After pacote selects a version, the adapter verifies that source's advertised checksum, extracts the original manifest, validates its transport identity, then applies manifest patches before Arborist reads its dependencies. Registries may omit dependencies from their packuments. Intentional metadata renames do not change the verified transport identity. npm may examine and verify a candidate it ultimately does not install; only the resulting graph is indexed.

The cache stores unpatched packuments and verified compressed archives, separated by registry, URL and advertised checksum. Cached metadata pins offline selection until `flushCache()` or `dropCache: true`. Patches and indexes are rebuilt per manager. Built-in memory/IndexedDB caches atomically commit a successful initialization; custom caches can implement `putMany(entries, signal)` for the same atomicity. Failed or cancelled operations keep the previous manager state usable.

The Worker owns ordinary fetching, verification, extraction, manifest hydration, Arborist, index collection and reference hashing. Expanded files stay there; the main thread receives a compact graph/index and handles queries. `read()` requests a freshly parsed resource through typed RPC. Custom `fetch` and patch closures run in the caller's realm: manifest callbacks run before dependency resolution, index callbacks process the prepared index, and resource callbacks run per read. The caller's cache remains the single transaction owner; custom response streams and compressed cache bytes cross the boundary, while expanded archives do not.

Each initialization prepares a candidate Worker. After index callbacks and cache commit succeed, its snapshot becomes current and the previous Worker retires after pending reads finish. Cancellation covers cache clearing before Worker creation too; `destroy()` immediately aborts active operations and releases all of that manager's Workers. It settles without waiting for an unresolved custom cache callback. Cancellation stops waiting and prevents late publication; side effects inside a custom callback remain that callback's responsibility. Call `destroy()` when the manager is no longer needed. Custom callbacks and compact snapshot processing can still consume UI time; no stage CPU ranking or responsiveness improvement is claimed.

Authored browser source and adapters use TypeScript/ESM. `worker-client.ts` and `protocol.ts` define the boundary; `worker/prepare.ts` coordinates `registry.ts`, `archive.ts`, `graph.ts`, `arborist.ts` and `index.ts`. `worker/adapters/` contains narrow Node compatibility modules. The build generates tiny CommonJS export bridges for upstream `require()` shapes and embeds the compiled Worker; npm's source remains unchanged. `bun run typecheck` checks both host and Worker code.

`sourceContext: { id: resource.id }` follows the requesting resource's package and declared dependency closure, preferring nearer dependencies. It does not fall through into unrelated packages. `sourceContext.package.version` selects a **package version**; `resolve(..., { version })` and `url|version` select a **FHIR resource version**. Without context, configured roots take precedence in configuration order, followed by dependencies. If several installation scopes contain the same package version, use a resource ID for an unambiguous context.

The browser entry shares search, index parsing, index recovery, patch helpers and diagnostics with the Node entry. Index patches run per manager load and resource patches per read. Browser contexts retain npm's installation locations, `edge.to` and `Link.target`; repeated versions in different locations keep distinct IDs. Explicit roots with different versions of the same name use ordinary synthetic npm workspaces. The Node installer, entry and CLI retain their existing behavior.

Supported dependency specifications are npm semver ranges, exact versions and tags; npm handles dependency/peer/optional placement. Selected archives always fail closed on integrity, identity or admission errors. Executable packages, bundled dependencies, git/file/URL/npm-alias sources and filesystem-path imports (`addLocalPackage` / `addTgzPackage`) are unsupported. The Worker explicitly rejects unsupported runtime operations. Web Streams, gzip `DecompressionStream` and Web Crypto require a modern secure browser context.

Use `signal` to cancel work, `requestTimeoutMs` (default 60 seconds) and `graphTimeoutMs` (default 180 seconds) to bound requests and preparation. `archiveLimits` defaults to 200 MiB decompressed bytes and 25,000 entries per archive; compressed responses are bounded too. Large public dependency sets may need higher explicit bounds. The real Chrome US Core acceptance run uses:

```typescript
const manager = createCanonicalManager({
    packages: ['hl7.fhir.us.core@6.1.0'],
    requestTimeoutMs: 120_000,
    graphTimeoutMs: 270_000,
    archiveLimits: { maxBytes: 512 * 1024 * 1024, maxFiles: 50_000 },
});
await manager.init();
```

Browser checks: `bun run test:browser:install` installs Chromium once, then `bun run test:browser` builds the embedded engine and runs packaged-consumer CORS and persistent-reload tests. Set `FCM_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to an existing Chrome executable. Set `FCM_BROWSER_LIVE=1` to include real US Core 6.1.0 loading with all eleven archive checks. Node/browser graph fixtures compare public Arborist APIs on compatible native Node 22.22.2+, 24.15+, or 26+.

## CLI Usage

The package includes a powerful command-line interface (`fcm`) for managing FHIR packages and searching resources without writing code.

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager

# Or use with npx
npx @atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager

# Or run directly with bunx
bunx @atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager
```

### Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new project and initialize with FHIR packages
mkdir my-fhir-project && cd my-fhir-project
fcm init hl7.fhir.r4.core

# Search for resources
fcm search Patient

# Get a specific resource
fcm resolve http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient
```

### Commands

#### `fcm init`
Initialize FHIR packages in the current directory.

```bash
# Initialize with packages
fcm init hl7.fhir.r4.core hl7.fhir.us.core@5.0.1

# With custom registry
fcm init hl7.fhir.r4.core --registry https://packages.simplifier.net

# Initialize from existing package.json
fcm init
```

Configuration is stored in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "fcm": {
    "packages": ["hl7.fhir.r4.core", "hl7.fhir.us.core@5.0.1"],
    "registry": "https://fs.get-ig.org/pkgs/"
  }
}
```

#### `fcm list`
List installed packages or resources.

```bash
# List all packages
fcm list

# List resources in a package
fcm list hl7.fhir.r4.core

# Filter by type
fcm list hl7.fhir.r4.core --type StructureDefinition

# Output as JSON
fcm list --json
```

#### `fcm search`
Search for resources with advanced filtering and prefix matching capabilities.

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Search by URL pattern
fcm search Patient

# Prefix search - space-separated terms match URL components
fcm search str def pat  # Matches: StructureDefinition/Patient
```

**Resource Type Shortcuts:**
```bash
fcm search -sd          # All StructureDefinitions
fcm search -cs          # All CodeSystems
fcm search -vs          # All ValueSets
fcm search -sd patient  # Patient-related StructureDefinitions
```

**Advanced Filtering:**
```bash
# Filter by type (-t)
fcm search -t Extension              # All Extensions
fcm search -t Patient                # Resources with type="Patient"
fcm search -sd -t Patient            # Patient StructureDefinition specifically

# Filter by kind (-k)
fcm search -k resource               # All resources (Patient, Observation, etc.)
fcm search -k complex-type           # All complex types (HumanName, Address, etc.)
fcm search -k primitive-type         # All primitive types (string, boolean, etc.)

# Combine filters
fcm search -t Extension -k complex-type  # All Extension complex types
fcm search -sd pat -t Extension          # Patient-related Extensions

# Filter by package
fcm search allergy --package hl7.fhir.us.core

# Output as JSON
fcm search Patient --json
```

**Output Format:**
By default, results are displayed one per line in the format:
```
url, {"resourceType":"...", "kind":"...", "type":"..."}
```

Example output:
```
http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient, {"resourceType":"StructureDefinition","kind":"resource","type":"Patient"}
```

#### `fcm resolve`
Get a resource by its canonical URL.

```bash
# Display resource
fcm resolve http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient

# Save to file
fcm resolve http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administrative-gender > gender.json

# Show only specific fields
fcm resolve http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient --fields url,type,kind
```

#### `fcm searchparam`
Display search parameters for a specific FHIR resource type.

```bash
# Display search parameters for Patient resource
fcm searchparam Patient

# Output as JSON
fcm searchparam Observation --format json

# Export as CSV for spreadsheet analysis
fcm searchparam Encounter --format csv > encounter-params.csv
```

**Output Formats:**
- **table** (default): Displays each parameter in a multiline format with full data
- **json**: Outputs as JSON array with code, type, expression, and url fields  
- **csv**: Exports as CSV for spreadsheet analysis

Example output (table format):
```
Code:       active
Type:       token
Expression: Patient.active
URL:        http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Patient-active

## Core Concepts

### Package Management

The manager automatically handles FHIR package installation:

1. Creates a working directory if it doesn't exist
2. Initializes a `package.json` for dependency management
3. Installs specified FHIR packages using npm
4. Scans packages for `.index.json` files
5. Builds an in-memory index of all resources
6. Persists cache to `.fcm/cache/index.json`

### Resource Resolution

Resources are identified by:
- **Canonical URL**: The unique identifier for a FHIR resource
- **Reference ID**: An opaque, deterministic hash based on package and file path
- **Package Context**: Optional package name/version constraints

## API Reference

### `CanonicalManager(config)`

Creates a new instance of the canonical manager.

```typescript
interface Config {
  packages: string[];               // FHIR packages to install (e.g., ["hl7.fhir.r4.core"])
  workingDir: string;               // Directory for packages and cache
  registry?: string;                // NPM registry URL (optional)
  dropCache?: boolean;              // Rebuild the cache instead of loading it from disk
  patches?: Partial<Patches>;       // Per-phase handler lists (see "Patches & defect handling")
  packageIndex?: PackageIndexMode;  // How to treat shipped .index.json files (default "use")
  /** @deprecated use `patches` — equivalent to package/resource handlers */
  preprocessPackage?: (ctx: PreprocessContext) => PreprocessContext;
  /** @deprecated use `packageIndex` */
  ignorePackageIndex?: boolean;
}
```

Example:
```typescript
const manager = CanonicalManager({
    packages: [
        "hl7.fhir.r4.core",
        "hl7.fhir.us.core@5.0.1"
    ],
    workingDir: "./fhir-packages",
    registry: "https://fs.get-ig.org/pkgs/"
});
```

### Patches & defect handling

Real-world FHIR packages ship defects (missing dependencies, canonical URL typos,
unavailable ValueSet bindings, cross-version type references, corrupt `.index.json`).
CanonicalManager exposes three knobs to work around them.

#### `packageIndex` — how to treat shipped `.index.json`

```typescript
type PackageIndexMode = "use" | "recover" | "regenerate";
```

- **`"use"`** (default): trust the shipped index; scan the directory only if it's
  absent. A corrupt index is **warned** about but not worked around (matches prior behavior).
- **`"recover"`**: use the index, but fall back to a **per-package** directory scan when
  it's corrupt or incomplete (unparseable, or references files missing on disk).
- **`"regenerate"`**: ignore shipped indexes and always scan.

`ignorePackageIndex` is a deprecated alias (`true` → `"regenerate"`, `false` → `"use"`);
setting both it and `packageIndex` throws.

#### `patches` — composable transforms and exclusions

`patches` is a single `Patches` object with an optional **list of handlers per phase**,
keyed by the value each handler transforms — `packageJson`, `indexEntry`, and `fhirResource`.
Each handler receives its package id, that value, and a diagnostics sink, and returns a
transformed value or `undefined` to no-op; the handlers in a phase run left-to-right. The
`indexEntry` handlers may also return `null` to **drop** the canonical (it never enters the
index). Provide only the phases you need; the deprecated `preprocessPackage` is appended
after your packageJson/fhirResource handlers.

```typescript
import type { PackagePatch } from "@atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager";

// A handler is (pkg, value, report) => transformedValue | undefined.
// Fix a package's declared version at the package phase:
const fixVersion: PackagePatch = (pkg, packageJson) => ({ ...packageJson, version: "1.2.3" });

// patches: { packageJson: [fixVersion] }
```

The bundled patch helpers are exported from the `@atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager/patch` subpath:

- **Scoping combinators** — `inPackage(match, [handlers])` applies handlers only to matching packages (name, `{name, version}`, or predicate) and nests; `inResource(url, [handlers])` scopes resource handlers to one canonical.
- **Manifest fixes** (`packageJson` phase) — `ensureDependency(deps)` makes a package declare each dependency at the given version (adds missing ones, adjusts mismatched ones, never adds a package to itself); `renamePackage(from, to)` fixes a typo'd manifest name.
- **Resource fixes** (`fhirResource` phase) — `replaceText(from, to)` substitutes a string throughout the serialized body (typo'd canonicals, wrong reference targets, unavailable ValueSet bindings — scope it!); `ensureCodes(url, codes)` appends missing codes to a CodeSystem without touching existing concepts.
- **Index fixes** (`indexEntry` phase) — `excludeCanonical({package?, url, reason})` drops a canonical from the index (output *and* resolution), recording the reason in `report()`.
- **Plumbing** — `applyPatches`, `matchPackage`.

For example, `excludeCanonical` dropping a canonical (e.g. an R4 extension that references an R5-only type):

```typescript
import { CanonicalManager } from "@atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager";
import { excludeCanonical } from "@atomic-ehr/fhir-canonical-manager/patch";

const manager = CanonicalManager({
    packages: ["hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r4"],
    workingDir: "./fhir-packages",
    patches: {
        indexEntry: [
            excludeCanonical({
                url: "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/specimen-additive",
                reason: "Uses CodeableReference, not available in R4",
            }),
        ],
    },
});
```

> **Caching note:** the on-disk index records what the packages ship, so managers with
> different `patches` can share a working directory.
>
> - `indexEntry` and `fhirResource` run per load and per read — change them freely.
> - `packageJson` also runs at install and scan time and is part of the cached package
>   metadata, so changing it still needs `dropCache: true` (or a cleared working dir).

#### `report()` — why you see what you see

```typescript
const report = manager.report(); // ReportEntry[]
//   { kind: "index-recovery"; package; reason; recovered }
//   | { kind: "exclusion"; package; url; reason }
//   | { kind: "deprecation"; message }
```

Returns a record of every defect-handling action taken (index recoveries, exclusions,
deprecation notices), so downstream tools can explain why a canonical is missing or changed.

> **Cached-run caveat:** `exclusion` entries are recorded on every run, cached or not, because
> the `indexEntry` phase runs on every load. `index-recovery` entries are only produced while
> **building** the index, so a cached run reports nothing for them — use `dropCache: true` to
> rebuild if you need to see why a package's index was repaired.

### `init(): Promise<void>`

Initializes the manager. This method:
- Ensures working directory exists
- Creates `.fcm/cache` directory
- Checks for existing cache
- If no cache: installs packages and builds index
- If cache exists: loads from disk (fast startup)

```typescript
await manager.init();
```

### `resolve(url, options?): Promise<Resource>`

Resolves a canonical URL directly to a FHIR resource.

```typescript
// Simple resolution
const patient = await manager.resolve(
    'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient'
);

// With package constraint
const patient = await manager.resolve(
    'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient',
    { package: 'hl7.fhir.r4.core' }
);

// With version constraint
const patient = await manager.resolve(
    'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient',
    { version: '4.0.1' }
);
```

### `resolveEntry(url, options?): Promise<IndexEntry>`

Resolves a canonical URL to an index entry (metadata only).

```typescript
const entry = await manager.resolveEntry(
    'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient'
);

console.log(entry);
// {
//   id: "opaque-reference-id",
//   resourceType: "StructureDefinition",
//   url: "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient",
//   version: "4.0.1",
//   kind: "resource",
//   type: "Patient",
//   package: { name: "hl7.fhir.r4.core", version: "4.0.1" }
// }
```

### `read(reference): Promise<Resource>`

Reads a resource using its reference.

```typescript
const entry = await manager.resolveEntry(url);
const resource = await manager.read(entry);
```

### `search(params): Promise<Resource[]>`

Searches and returns full resources matching criteria.

```typescript
// Get all StructureDefinitions
const structures = await manager.search({
    type: 'StructureDefinition'
});

// Get all resources of kind "resource"
const resources = await manager.search({
    kind: 'resource'
});

// Complex search
const valuesets = await manager.search({
    type: 'ValueSet',
    package: { name: 'hl7.fhir.r4.core', version: '4.0.1' }
});
```

### `searchEntries(params): Promise<IndexEntry[]>`

Searches and returns index entries (metadata only).

```typescript
// Find all CodeSystems
const entries = await manager.searchEntries({
    type: 'CodeSystem'
});

// Find by URL
const entries = await manager.searchEntries({
    url: 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient'
});
```

Search parameters:
- `kind?: string` - Resource kind (e.g., 'resource', 'datatype', 'primitive')
- `url?: string` - Canonical URL (exact match)
- `type?: string` - Resource type (e.g., 'StructureDefinition', 'ValueSet')
- `version?: string` - Resource version
- `package?: PackageId` - Filter by package name and version

### `packages(): Promise<PackageId[]>`

Lists all loaded packages.

```typescript
const packages = await manager.packages();
// [
//   { name: "hl7.fhir.r4.core", version: "4.0.1" },
//   { name: "hl7.fhir.us.core", version: "5.0.1" }
// ]
```

### `addPackages(packages: string[]): Promise<void>`

Add (and install if needed) extra FHIR packages at runtime.

```typescript
await manager.addPackages(
    "hl7.fhir.us.core@5.0.1",
    "hl7.fhir.us.davinci-drug-formulary"
);
```

- Accepts one or more package specifiers: name or name@version
- If manager not yet initialised, they are appended and normal `init()` flow handles install
- Already present packages are skipped (idempotent)
- New ones are installed, `node_modules` re‑scanned, cache persisted
- Resources become immediately available to `resolve`, `search`, CLI commands

Returns: `Promise<void>` (resolves when indexing is updated)

### `getSearchParametersForResource(resourceType): Promise<SearchParameter[]>`

Gets all search parameters applicable to a specific FHIR resource type.

```typescript
// Get search parameters for Patient resource
const searchParams = await manager.getSearchParametersForResource('Patient');

// Each parameter contains FHIR SearchParameter fields
searchParams.forEach(param => {
    console.log(`${param.code}: ${param.type} - ${param.expression}`);
});

// Example output:
// identifier: token - Patient.identifier
// name: string - Patient.name
// birthdate: date - Patient.birthDate
// gender: token - Patient.gender
```

Returns an array of SearchParameter resources with all FHIR fields preserved, including:
- `url`: Canonical URL of the search parameter
- `code`: Search parameter name used in queries
- `type`: Parameter type (token, string, date, reference, etc.)
- `expression`: FHIRPath expression
- `base`: Array of resource types this parameter applies to
- Additional FHIR SearchParameter fields

### `destroy(): Promise<void>`

Cleans up resources and clears cache from memory (disk cache persists).

```typescript
await manager.destroy();
```

## CLI Reference

The `fcm` command-line interface provides comprehensive FHIR resource management capabilities.

### Command Overview

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fcm init [packages...]` | Initialize FHIR packages in current directory |
| `fcm list [package]` | List packages or resources |
| `fcm search [terms...]` | Search resources with advanced filtering |
| `fcm resolve <url>` | Get a resource by canonical URL |
| `fcm searchparam <resourceType>` | Display search parameters for a resource type |

### Global Options

- `--help`, `-h` - Show help information
- `--version`, `-v` - Show version number
- `--json` - Output results as JSON (available for list, search, resolve)

### Search Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-sd` | Filter to StructureDefinitions | `fcm search -sd` |
| `-cs` | Filter to CodeSystems | `fcm search -cs` |
| `-vs` | Filter to ValueSets | `fcm search -vs` |
| `-t <type>` | Filter by type field | `fcm search -t Extension` |
| `-k <kind>` | Filter by kind field | `fcm search -k resource` |

| `--package <name>` | Filter by package | `fcm search --package hl7.fhir.us.core` |

### Prefix Search

The search command supports intelligent prefix matching. When you provide multiple space-separated terms, each term is matched as a prefix against URL components:

```bash
# Search for "str" AND "def" AND "pat" as prefixes
fcm search str def pat

# This matches URLs like:
# - http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient
# - http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/PatientContact
```

### Filter Combinations

Filters can be combined for precise searching:

```bash
# Find all Extension complex types
fcm search -t Extension -k complex-type

# Find Patient-related Extensions
fcm search -sd pat -t Extension

# Find all primitive types in US Core
fcm search -k primitive-type --package hl7.fhir.us.core
```

### Output Formats

**Default (Single-line):**
```
http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient, {"resourceType":"StructureDefinition","kind":"resource","type":"Patient"}
```

**JSON Format:**
```bash
fcm search Patient --json
```

Returns full IndexEntry objects as JSON array.

## Directory Structure

After initialization, your working directory will contain:

```
workingDir/
├── package.json          # NPM package file
├── node_modules/         # Installed FHIR packages
│   ├── hl7.fhir.r4.core/
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   ├── .index.json   # FHIR resource index
│   │   └── *.json        # FHIR resources
│   └── .../
└── .fcm/
    └── cache/
        └── index.json    # Cached index for fast startup
```

## Cache Format

The cache is stored as a JSON file with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  entries: {
    "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient": [
      {
        id: "hash-based-id",
        resourceType: "StructureDefinition",
        url: "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient",
        version: "4.0.1",
        kind: "resource",
        type: "Patient",
        package: { name: "hl7.fhir.r4.core", version: "4.0.1" }
      }
    ]
  },
  packages: {
    "hl7.fhir.r4.core": {
      id: { name: "hl7.fhir.r4.core", version: "4.0.1" },
      path: "/path/to/node_modules/hl7.fhir.r4.core",
      canonical: "http://hl7.org/fhir",
      fhirVersions: ["4.0.1"]
    }
  },
  references: {
    "hash-based-id": {
      packageName: "hl7.fhir.r4.core",
      packageVersion: "4.0.1",
      filePath: "/path/to/resource.json",
      resourceType: "StructureDefinition",
      url: "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient",
      version: "4.0.1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Multiple Packages

```typescript
const manager = CanonicalManager({
    packages: [
        "hl7.fhir.r4.core",
        "hl7.fhir.us.core@5.0.1",
        "hl7.fhir.us.davinci-drug-formulary"
    ],
    workingDir: "./fhir-packages"
});

await manager.init();

// Search across all packages
const allValueSets = await manager.search({ type: 'ValueSet' });

// Search in specific package
const usCoreProfiles = await manager.search({
    type: 'StructureDefinition',
    package: { name: 'hl7.fhir.us.core', version: '5.0.1' }
});
```

### Custom Registry Configuration

```typescript
// Use the default FHIR package registry
const manager = CanonicalManager({
    packages: ["hl7.fhir.r4.core"],
    workingDir: "./fhir-packages",
    registry: "https://fs.get-ig.org/pkgs/"
});

// Use a custom NPM registry
const manager = CanonicalManager({
    packages: ["hl7.fhir.r4.core"],
    workingDir: "./fhir-packages",
    registry: "https://my-private-registry.com"
});
```

### Building a FHIR Validator

```typescript
async function validateResource(resource: any, manager: CanonicalManager) {
    // Get the profile URL from the resource
    const profileUrl = resource.meta?.profile?.[0];
    if (!profileUrl) {
        throw new Error('No profile specified');
    }

    // Resolve the StructureDefinition
    const profile = await manager.resolve(profileUrl);

    // Validate resource against profile
    // ... validation logic ...
}
```

### Analyzing Package Dependencies

```typescript
async function analyzeValueSetDependencies(manager: CanonicalManager) {
    // Get all ValueSets
    const valueSets = await manager.search({ type: 'ValueSet' });

    const dependencies = new Map<string, Set<string>>();

    for (const vs of valueSets) {
        const vsPackage = vs.package?.name || 'unknown';

        // Check compose.include for external code systems
        if (vs.compose?.include) {
            for (const include of vs.compose.include) {
                if (include.system) {
                    try {
                        const cs = await manager.resolve(include.system);
                        const csPackage = cs.package?.name || 'unknown';

                        if (csPackage !== vsPackage) {
                            if (!dependencies.has(vsPackage)) {
                                dependencies.set(vsPackage, new Set());
                            }
                            dependencies.get(vsPackage)!.add(csPackage);
                        }
                    } catch {
                        // External code system not in our packages
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dependencies;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Startup Performance

- **First run**: Slower due to package installation and index building
- **Subsequent runs**: Fast startup by loading from disk cache
- **Cache invalidation**: Delete `.fcm/cache` to force rebuild

### Memory Usage

- All index entries are kept in memory for fast lookup
- Resource content is loaded on-demand
- For large package sets, consider memory requirements

### Best Practices

1. **Reuse manager instances**: Create once, use many times
2. **Use `searchEntries()` for metadata**: Faster than `search()` when you don't need full resources
3. **Specify package constraints**: Faster resolution when package is known
4. **Cache working directory**: Share between application instances

## Error Handling

The manager throws errors for:
- Not initialized: Call `init()` before other methods
- Resource not found: Canonical URL doesn't exist
- Invalid reference: Reference ID is invalid
- Package installation failures: Network or registry issues

```typescript
try {
    const resource = await manager.resolve('http://invalid.url/Resource');
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to resolve:', error.message);
}
```

## TypeScript Types

```typescript
interface Reference {
    id: string;              // Opaque identifier
    resourceType: string;    // FHIR resource type
}

interface PackageId {
    name: string;           // Package name
    version: string;        // Package version
}

interface IndexEntry extends Reference {
    indexVersion: number;   // Index format version
    kind?: string;         // resource, datatype, primitive, etc.
    url?: string;          // Canonical URL
    type?: string;         // Specific type (e.g., "Patient")
    version?: string;      // Resource version
    package?: PackageId;   // Source package
}

interface Resource extends Reference {
    url?: string;          // Canonical URL
    version?: string;      // Resource version
    [key: string]: any;    // Other FHIR properties
}

interface SourceContext {
    id?: string;
    package?: PackageId;
    url?: string;
    path?: string;
}
```

## Development

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun run test
```

This generates the embedded browser engine before running tests. After `bun run build:engine`, targeted tests can use `bun test` directly.

To run the example:

```bash
bun run example.ts
```
